# Making of Lumina

Lumina is a further exploration of using p5.js and WebGL shaders together to generate a striking visual style that maintains a balance between organic and digital elements. We employed a serial technique to structure the process.

n this project, we created basic shapes using `vertex()` & `curveVertex()` functions in p5.js. Later, these shapes were processed through an FBM (Fractal Brownian Motion) Shader to create a cloudy texture. This cloudy texture was then passed into another shader, which applied a swirl effect to it. For the final process, we used a custom shader to manipulate the canvas, creating fractured and bent entities. 

## Detailed explanation of the *serial* process.

1. Creating shapes using `vertex()` & `curveVertex()` in p5js.

2. First shader; **FBM**

3. Adding *stars* before the swirl

4. Second Shader; **Swirl**

5. Last Shader; **Spatialize**

6. Again adding *stars* on top of everything

## Compositions 

The visual structure contains 9 general composition type, each are highly varied, some examples;

* composition 1


* composition 2


* composition 3


* composition 4


* composition 5


* composition 6


* composition 7


* composition 8


* composition 9

## Last Words

This collection is also a reflection on human exploration and discovery. As our technological reach extends into space, art follows as a parallel journey, exploring both internal and external realms. The collection emphasizes humanity's quest to understand these celestial phenomena, using gravitational forces as a drawing context and diverse optical instruments as a metaphor for our observational tools.
