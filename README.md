# Title in Progress

*Title in Progress* is a further exploration of using p5js and webgl shaders together to create striking visuals in a balance of organic-digital. We used a *serial* technique to create our steps.

In this project we created some basic shapes using `vertex()` & `curveVertex` in p5js. Later this shapes goes in to a **FBM Shader** to create a cloudy texture. 
This cloudy texture goes into another shader which puts a **swirl** on top of it. For the last process we are using a custom shader to manipulate the canvas to create fractured, bended nursaries. 

Here is a detailed explanation of this *serial* process.

2. First shader; **Fbm**

3. Adding *stars* before the swirll

4. Second Shader; **Swirl**

5. Last Shader; **Spatialize**

6. Again adding *stars* on top of everything
